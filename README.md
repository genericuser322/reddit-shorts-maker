# reddit-shorts-maker
I wrote a script that basically scrapes /AskReddit for posts, takes the title and comments and turns them into a video

THIS PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED!!!! 

So far I've written it so it <b>works</b>

it is not readable
it doesn't contain comments
it's hard to set up
it's not finished
there's bugs


the files are in the master branch

to use this you'll need to create a reddit app, take the codes and copy paste them in the code
also you can switch the videos with your own (you should because mine are barely 720p)
be careful running the code because it will *quickly*(python speed) take all the storage from your drive because it creates the sound files but wont delete the excess ones, just overwrite the one's needed.
